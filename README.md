Here is my own implementation for Gaussian Processes. 

My implementation is based on the [TediGP](https://github.com/jdavidrcamacho/tedi) from João Camacho. It is thus the main requirement of this code. 

This implementation is built in a way to use `.rdb` files produced by [LBL](https://github.com/njcuk9999/lbl) from reduced SPIRou observations, but it can easily be adapted to other kind of data.
